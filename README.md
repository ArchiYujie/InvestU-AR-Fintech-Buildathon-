# InvestU-AR-Fintech-Buildathon-
2019 MIT Fintech Buildathon (https://on.mitfintech.com/optin32250405)  

Our solution combines AR, in-app gaming, and investment education all into one platform. 
This is focused on young adults who have bank accounts but have not taken the next step towards investing for their future. This addresses the challenge because we are providing a resource for young adults to improve their financial literacy through technology.  

Team members: Christa Graverson, Kinsy Hassan-Ali, Liwei Xiao, Matthew Kappas, Yujie Wang, and Wendy (Ziyue) Wu
